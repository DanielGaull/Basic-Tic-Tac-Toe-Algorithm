I created this program in 24 hours for CodeDay Chicago 2018 (Winter), and won Best in Class AI. 

Note: I originally intended to use Q-Learning for this program, but it was too slow on my computer (and too complicated). As a result, some of the files mention "Q-Learning" even though this is not the currently used learning algorithm (the one used is a lot simpler and easier to follow)
